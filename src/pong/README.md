# üïπÔ∏è Prompt Pong

This interactive two-player game of pong showcases the on-device inferencing capabilities of the Snapdragon X Elite platform. Players compete and the round's winner can dynamically alter the game environment by prompting an on-device large language model (LLM). This real-time sample demonstrates how local AI processing can enable adaptive gameplay, personalized experiences, and low-latency decision-making all without relying on cloud connectivity.
